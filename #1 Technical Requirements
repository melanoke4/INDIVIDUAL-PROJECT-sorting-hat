TODO: #5 You must use a loop other than a for loop

TODO: #6 Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function except for your initial init() function

Add Button Hints

TODO: #12 When a new student is added an object should be created and that object should be pushed into an array of students that then prints to the dom.

Expel Button Hints

TODO: #13 Think of a way you can expel students without just hiding those divs on the page. This would mean when the button is clicked you modify the array of students and pass the new array into your print to dom function. Double hint - put a unique id in the student object when you create them.

OPTIONAL 
TODO: House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.

TODO: Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)

TODO: Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently from Hogwarts students.
